In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up a jump box on an Amazon EKS cluster. A jump box is a secure server that acts as a gateway for accessing resources in a private network.

## Prerequisites
- An existing Amazon EKS cluster.
- kubectl configured to access your EKS cluster.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.

## Steps to Set Up the Jump Box
1. **Create a Bastion Host**: Launch an EC2 instance in the same VPC as your EKS cluster.
2. **Configure Security Groups**: Ensure the security group allows SSH access and communication with the EKS cluster.
3. **Install Required Tools**: Install kubectl, AWS CLI, and other necessary tools on the EC2 instance.
4. **Access the Jump Box**: SSH into the EC2 instance and use it to interact with the EKS cluster.
