Losing a PEM key in AWS can be problematic because the key is required to access instances securely. once you’ve lost or misplaced a PEM key in AWS, there’s no direct way to retrieve or recover it from AWS itself. This is by design to maintain the security of your instances. The private key is meant to remain confidential, and AWS does not store or keep copies of user-generated keys for security reasons.
