# Argo CD Backup and Recovery Documentation

## Overview

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Proper backup and recovery strategies are essential to ensure that your Argo CD applications and configurations are safeguarded. This document provides detailed instructions for backing up and restoring Argo CD resources using the `argocd` CLI.

## Backup Procedure

### 1. **Exporting Argo CD Resources**

To back up Argo CD resources, use the `argocd admin export` command. This command exports the Argo CD configuration and resources to a YAML file. The exported file includes:

- ConfigMaps (e.g., Argo CD settings, RBAC settings, TLS certificates)
- Secrets (e.g., cluster credentials, repository secrets)
- Custom Resources (e.g., AppProjects, Applications, ApplicationSets)

#### Command

```bash
argocd admin export > backup.yaml -n argocd
```

### 2. **Backup Verification**

Ensure that the backup file contains all necessary configurations and resources. Verify the backup by inspecting the YAML file and comparing it with your expected configuration.

## Recovery Procedure

### 1. **Restoring Argo CD Resources**

To restore Argo CD resources from the backup YAML file, use the `argocd admin import` command. This command imports the previously exported resources back into the Argo CD namespace.

#### Command

```bash
argocd admin import - < backup.yaml -n argocd
```

### 2. **Post-Restoration Steps**

After importing Argo CD resources, you might need to:

- **Reapply Cluster Configurations:** If your backup included cluster configurations and secrets, ensure they are properly applied to the cluster.
  
- **Reconfigure Repository Secrets:** Re-import repository credentials and ensure connectivity to the repositories is restored.

- **Verify Resource Integrity:** Check that all Argo CD resources (Applications, AppProjects, etc.) are correctly restored and functioning as expected.

### 3. **Testing**

After recovery, perform tests to verify that:
- Argo CD applications are functioning correctly.
- All expected applications and projects are present.
- Configurations such as RBAC policies and settings are accurate.
