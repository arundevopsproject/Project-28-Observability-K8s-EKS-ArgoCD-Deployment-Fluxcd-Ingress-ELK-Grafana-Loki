## Introduction

Securely managing access to AWS services is critical when running applications on Amazon EKS. Both **AWS EKS Pod Identity** and **IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)** allow you to assign AWS credentials to your applications without embedding long-lived keys. They do so in fundamentally different ways—either by directly binding a role to each pod (Pod Identity) or by linking an IAM role to a Kubernetes service account that pods consume (IRSA).

In this guide, we’ll rephrase and update the discussion by comparing these methods on aspects like role extensibility, cluster scalability, role scalability, role reusability, and environment support. For those who want to jump into hands-on implementation, refer to these detailed guides:

## Overview of AWS EKS Pod Identity

**AWS EKS Pod Identity** assigns an AWS IAM role directly to individual pods. This enables each pod to obtain short-lived AWS STS credentials tailored specifically for its operational needs. Key features include:

- **Direct Pod Association:** Each pod carries its own AWS identity without relying on a shared service account.
- **Enhanced Security Isolation:** With pod-level identities, if a pod is compromised, the breach remains isolated to its specific permissions.
- **Simpler Role Extensibility:** There is no need to change the role’s trust policy when deploying into new clusters—one IAM role can work across multiple clusters.
- **Hands-On Example:** Follow the step-by-step instructions in our guide [Simplifying AWS EKS Pod Identity](./pod-identity/README.MD) to see how to implement this model.

## Overview of IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)

**IRSA** uses Kubernetes service accounts as the bridge to assign IAM roles. Pods that leverage a service account inherit the AWS permissions defined by its IAM role. This method is built on native Kubernetes features:

- **Service Account-Based Access:** IAM roles are linked to service accounts rather than individual pods.
- **Ease of Credential Management:** AWS temporarily provides credentials without extra sidecar containers or additional tooling.
- **Role Reusability:** The same IAM role can be assigned to multiple pods via a shared service account; however, every pod assumes all the role’s permissions.
- **Broader Environmental Support:** IRSA isn’t limited to EKS—it can also be implemented with Amazon EKS Anywhere, Red Hat OpenShift on AWS, and self-managed Kubernetes clusters on EC2 instances.
- **Hands-On Example:** To get started, consult our detailed guide [AWS EKS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](./eks-irsa/README.MD).

## Detailed Comparison: Key Differences and Considerations

Below is an enhanced comparison table that rephrases the critical differences between EKS Pod Identity and IRSA, based on role and scalability aspects:

| **Feature**             | **EKS Pod Identity**                                                                                                                                                      | **IRSA**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role Extensibility**  | No requirement to update the IAM role’s trust policy for every new cluster. This flexibility can simplify role management across environments.                           | Each new EKS cluster requires an update of the IAM role’s trust policy to include the new OIDC provider endpoint.                                                                                 |
| **Cluster Scalability** | Does not need an IAM OIDC provider configured. This reduces setup overhead and avoids global limits.                                                                        | Requires setting up an IAM OIDC provider; be aware of the default global limit of 100 OIDC providers per AWS account.                                                                              |
| **Role Scalability**    | Trust relationships between the IAM role and pods are managed without explicit definitions in the trust policy, eliminating policy size concerns.                        | Requires explicit mapping between IAM roles and service accounts with trust policies. Note that you can add up to eight trust relationships per trust policy due to size limits.              |
| **Role Reusability**    | AWS STS temporary credentials include additional session tags such as the cluster name, namespace, and service account name, meaning roles are uniquely identifiable.  | Does not support AWS STS session tags. A single IAM role reused across clusters means that every pod under that role will obtain the same set of permissions, reducing granularity.         |
| **Environments Supported** | Only available on Amazon EKS, making it a specialized solution for managed Kubernetes on AWS.                                                                               | More versatile as it is supported by Amazon EKS, Amazon EKS Anywhere, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, and self-managed Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EC2.                                |
| **EKS Versions Supported**  | Supported on EKS Kubernetes versions 1.24 or later, making it ideal for newer clusters.                                                                                   | Supported across all currently supported EKS cluster versions, providing wider compatibility.                                                                                                   |

## Choosing the Right Approach

### When to Choose AWS EKS Pod Identity
- **Granular Control:** If you need individual pods to have distinct AWS permissions, this approach is more secure.
- **Simpler Trust Management:** Avoid the need to update trust policies when adding new clusters.
- **Modern Clusters:** Best suited for environments running EKS Kubernetes 1.24 or later.

### When to Choose IRSA
- **Operational Simplicity:** Benefit from native integration with Kubernetes service accounts to manage IAM roles seamlessly.
- **Role Reusability:** Ideal if multiple pods share the same access requirements across clusters.
- **Environmental Flexibility:** Suitable for a wider range of Kubernetes setups, not just standard EKS clusters.

## Practical Implementation Steps

### Implementing EKS Pod Identity

1. **IAM Role Preparation:**  
   Create an IAM role with fine-grained policies suited to your pod’s requirements.

2. **Pod Configuration:**  
   Modify your pod definitions to include annotations or use sidecar approaches that facilitate credential injection.

3. **Deployment and Verification:**  
   Deploy your pods and validate that they can access AWS resources using the temporary AWS STS credentials.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   Use AWS CloudTrail and logging to track the usage of these credentials and ensure compliance.

*For a detailed tutorial, see [Simplifying AWS EKS Pod Identity](./pod-identity/README.MD).*

### Implementing IRSA

1. **Setup OIDC Provider:**  
   Configure an OIDC provider for your EKS cluster if not already set up.

2. **Create and Annotate Service Account:**  
   Define a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with an appropriate IAM role.

3. **Deploy the Workloads:**  
   Update your deployment manifests to use the new service account and validate that pods receive temporary credentials.

4. **Security Check:**  
   Verify the role’s trust policies and monitor credential usage through AWS auditing services.

*For a comprehensive walkthrough, refer to [AWS EKS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](./eks-irsa/README.MD).*

## Conclusion

Both AWS EKS Pod Identity and IRSA provide strong mechanisms for assigning AWS credentials to your Kubernetes pods, though they address the challenge in different ways. EKS Pod Identity offers more granular, pod-specific control without the need for updating trust policies across clusters, whereas IRSA leverages native Kubernetes service accounts and supports a broader range of environments at the potential cost of lesser granularity.

Your choice depends on your specific security needs, scalability considerations, and the overall architecture of your Kubernetes clusters. Whether you require individual pod-level access control or prefer the streamlined management of shared service accounts, understanding these differences will help you design a more secure and efficient cloud-native environment.
