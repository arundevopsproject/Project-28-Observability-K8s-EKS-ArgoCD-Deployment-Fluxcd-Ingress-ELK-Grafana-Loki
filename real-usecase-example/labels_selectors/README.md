# Labels & Selectors 
The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes. The API currently supports two types of selectors: equality-based and set-based. A label selector can be made of multiple requirements which are comma-separated.

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects. Labels can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time. Each object can have a set of key/value labels defined. Each Key must be unique for a given object.

```
"metadata": {
  "labels": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}
```
