Question:
What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the master node?
node-to-node communication
===========
Answer:
Run: kubectl get nodes -o wide to see the IP address assigned to the controlplane node.

root@controlplane:~# kubectl get nodes controlplane -o wide
NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
controlplane   Ready    control-plane,master   4h46m   v1.20.0   10.3.116.12   <none>        Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1041-gcp   docker://19.3.0
root@controlplane:~#
In this case, the internal IP address used for node for node to node communication is 10.3.116.12.

Important Note : The result above is just an example, the node IP address will vary for each lab.

Next, find the network interface to which
this IP is assigned by making use of the ip a command:

root@controlplane:~# ip a | grep -B2 10.3.116.12
16476: eth0@if16477: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:0a:03:74:0c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 10.3.116.12/24 brd 10.3.116.255 scope global eth0
root@controlplane:~#
Here you can see that the interface associated with this IP is eth0 on the host.

Question: What is the port the kube-scheduler is listening on in the controlplane node?
=========
Answer:
 Use the command netstat -nplt
Here is a sample result of using the netstat command and searching for the scheduler process:

root@controlplane:~# netstat -nplt | grep scheduler
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10259         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3665/kube-scheduler
root@controlplane:~#
We can see that the kube-scheduler process binds to the port 10259 on the controlplane node.
